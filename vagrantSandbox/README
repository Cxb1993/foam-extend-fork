#+TITLE: Virtual machines for testing and Packaging
* Prerequisites
  These virtual machines require
  - VirtualBox :: for running from [[https://www.virtualbox.org]]
  - Vagrant :: to automatically set them up from [[http://www.vagrantup.com]]
* Starting
  A virtual machine is set up with
: vagrant up <machineName>
  will download a virtual machine image and set it up. It will then
  modify the image:
  - add packages required to compile OpenFOAM and package it
  - mount the directory of the sources
  - from this directory clone it to the local disc with mercurial or
    git (whatever the parent uses)
  One can then connect to the virtual machine with
: vagrant ssh <machinName>
  and will be in the =$HOME= directory of the user =vagrant= where in
  the directory =~/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-1.6-ext= the sources are
  available. Modifications can be pushed "outside" the virtual machine
  with
: hg push
  There is also a symbolic link =~/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-1.6-ext-parent=
  to the sources if you want to edit there directly. Use with care
  and don't compile in that directory unless you know what you're
  doing
* Virtual machines
  Currently existing virtual machines are
  - precise :: Latest LTS Ubuntu.
  - lucid :: Previous LTS Ubuntu. Currently problems
             with automatic setting up (something with the
             =postfix=-package)
  - maverick :: Tries to fix the problems with the
                =lucid=-machine. Not yet working
